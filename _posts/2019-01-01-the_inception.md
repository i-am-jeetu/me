During this long, cold, and dreary winter break, I was surfing the web, passing the time ~~(distracting myself from the meaningless monotonous life)~~. I stumbled upon many blogs/webs such as [Anish](https://www.anishathalye.com/), [Codehorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/) by StackOverflow's founder, and how can I forget this, the greatest of all **[this](https://medium.com/)** . 

Then I thought, I too must  ~~try to~~ write and maintain my personal blog. And as much I know myself, I am sure I will lose interest in this and quit, falsely blaming my lack of time.

The stupid computer science student in me did not want to use any from the plethora of simple online tools available like Wix, or WordPress. ~~Foolish me!! These tools are meant to ease up your life!!~~ Instead, I decided to make it all from scratch. It did not go as planned, and later I resorted to using tools like Jekyll (and I loved it), to make it easier.

I haven't decided what sort of wacky useless error-prone misleading kinds of stuff, I am gonna write here. Lets See. 

So here I am. Wish me luck. Special thanks to **Grammarly** for hiding my indecorous English from you (◠‿◕).

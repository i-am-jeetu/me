Currently, this website (rather webpage) is running free of cost, thanks to Github Pages free hosting. (although nothing is free, I am paying by sparing time,no worries, i have plenty). And posting blog update can not be easier thanks to Jekyll, I just have to write some rubbish in markdown and the html is generated on its own. The one thing that I struggled with is setting up the path (!!! The extra slashes !!!)
